        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These <strong>plant-based</strong> meatballs with spinach, nutritional yeast, and vegan bread crumbs deliver lots of flavor. We like more of a crunchy, dry meatball so these are baked in the oven without sauce but they can be simmered on the stovetop in marinara sauce, as well.</p>
        <p>Store cooked meatballs in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 2 months.</p>
