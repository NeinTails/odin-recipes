        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>2 ounces dry bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>3 quarters (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
                <li>2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1 quarter cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Pour egg into a small shallow bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken into egg, then into bread crumbs. Place coated chicken on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
